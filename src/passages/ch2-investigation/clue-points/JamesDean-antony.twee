James Dean's Georgetown mansion is large, but not the largest in sight. It's built like one of those California houses, not like the local ones, and it seems like a pretty quiet place. There's a placid white wall at chest height around the property, and the gates to the driveway are wrought of black iron, likely equipped with cameras and motion sensors.

You're met at the gate by a friendly but professional maid of some sort of Asian descent who escorts you into the a well-lit sitting room with some chairs, a big coffee table with an envelope, an ashtray, and some smokes on it, and a wooden bar nestled up against the wall. Opposite the bar is a giant window, overlooking a placid swimming pool. It's all very calm and relaxed.

James Dean takes only a minute to arrive, looking healthy. It always takes you a moment to take him seriously, since he's not even halfway through his twenties, but that'd probably be a mistake. You don't get to be COO by twenty-three without either serious chops, clandestine violence, or both. He sits down at the coffee table beside you, frowning at the envelope, but he composes himself quickly.

"Mr. Vice-President," he drawls, in the style of the youth, "it's good to see you again. Your Majesty, it's a pleasure to meet you." He holds his hand out to your wife.

"Likewise," she says, shaking it.

"Sorry," he says, pointing to the envelope, "do you mind if I take care of this first?"

"Sure, no problem. Sei," he says, grabbing the envelope off the table and peering at the return address, "can you take this to, uh, the accountant? Sorry, bills or something, you know." He grins sheepishly.

"Thanks," he says. He pulls a pocket knife out of his pants and slits the envelope, taking a moment to scan its contents. "Ah," he says, sighing and restuffing it, "bills, right? Anyways, Sei, can you take this to the accountant?"

His maid takes the envelope and leaves the room.

"Sorry," says James. He grabs the cigarettes off the table, flips the pack open, and holds them out to you. "Does Your Majesty smoke? Made to order. From <strong>Golden Lotus</strong>, very good."

"Thank you," says your wife, "but I don't smoke."

"Pity. And I know you don't," he says, nodding at you. "So. You wanted to talk."

"Yes. Thank you." James pauses, eyes wandering. "Yeah. I'm not sure I'd call him a friend, strictly speaking. I mean, you know his reputation, right?" You nod. Marlon did have a reputation for being temperamental, an asshole, a harsh boss, and a serial womanizer. Maybe 'friend' might have been overstating it. "Still, I appreciate the sentiment," he says, "and I don't want to give the impression that we were on bad terms. It's just Marlon was a prickly sort of fellow."
