<h1>CASE ONE</h1>\
<h2>The Case of the Raytheon CEO.</h2>\
<strong>March 29, 2021</strong>

You and your beautiful wife, Cleopatra, are lounging around on your gigantic pleasure barge, soaking up the sun and watching the Potomac go by, when both your phones light up at once.

You check the number. It's the FBI hotline. You take the call. "A murder!" cries the officer on the other side. "A murder most foul! Marlon Brando, CEO of Raytheon, is dead! This is now a matter of," and his voice drops to a whisper, "<em>national security!</em>"

"We'll be there in fifteen, you say, and hang up. You look over at Cleopatra.

"Timeâ€¦" you say in unison, "to fight crime!"

You burst into the conference room deep within the bowls of the FBI headquarters and assess its contents with lightning speed. In the center is a table, surrounded by chairs and filled with evidence. In front of the screen at the end of the room stands Special Agent Hortensia, sharp as always in her black suit. "What's the situation?" you ask, striding forward.

"You're feeling energetic today," she says, "aren't you?"

"A murderer is afoot, Hortensia! There's not a moment to waste!"

She clicks her tongue. "What did Dave tell you about the timeframe?"

"Nothing at all!"

"Marcus, Cleopatra, you may want to sit down. I suspect that me made the situation sound more acute than it is."

"Hortensia," sighs your wife, "this isn't a cold case, is it? I do so dislike those."

"It is not. We'll get to that in a moment. First, I've been instructed to read you this message from Sejanus." You perk up. Sejanus, the head of the FBI, has a fearsome reputation as a dangerous and shadowy power broker, forever working behind the scenes, but you've known him since he was young and that all seems overblown. "The message says, 'The President wants this taken care of by the ninth of March. He tells me that if you don't he will bar you from the Winter Ball. I am not so forgiving. If you don't get this taken care of by the ninth of March I will have to' - and I'm quoting exactly here - 'get stabby on you two.'"

"Ah, don't worry," you say, "he always says that about the stabbing."

"I'm just the messenger. Now, I've been assigned to support you for the duration of this case, as seems to be the custom. We can start the briefing when you're both ready."
