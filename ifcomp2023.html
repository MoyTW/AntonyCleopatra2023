    <p>Hello! My game, <strong>Antony & Cleopatra: Case IV: The Murder of Marlon Brando</strong> is a networked multiplayer game for two players, and as such can only be played when hosted on a trusted server. You can access it at <a href='https://muffituffiwuffi.itch.io/antony-and-cleopatra-case-iv'>https://muffituffiwuffi.itch.io/antony-and-cleopatra-case-iv</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for you interest!</p>

    <p>If you're interested in seeing how this is implemented, making your own multiplayer Twine games, or hosting your own server, you can find the source code for the game at <a href='https://github.com/MoyTW/AntonyCleopatra2023'>https://github.com/MoyTW/AntonyCleopatra2023</a> (private at the time of writing due to IFComp no-release rules - if I forget to unprivate it because I haven't slept in <em>too long</em> and you want to see it send me an email or something) and the server at <a href='https://github.com/MoyTW/MultiplayerTwineServer'>https://github.com/MoyTW/MultiplayerTwineServer</a>.

    <p>Please contact me at moytravis@gmail.com if you have any issues accessing the game, questions, comments, bug reports, or anything at all, really.</p>
